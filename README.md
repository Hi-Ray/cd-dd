  -r, --recursive          Recursively download directory and files
  -k, --keep-files [mode]  Keep files if they already exist in the output directory (choices: "all", "replace", "nothing", default: "all")

## How does caching work?
When the keep-files flag is set to "all" or "replace", a `.cddd` file will be created in every downloaded directory which holds a compressed version of the downloaded files which can identify whether a the current version of the file was already downloaded or not.  

If the keep-files flag is set to "all", existing valid files not be downloaded nor replaced.  
If the keep-files flag is set to "replace" existing files are downloaded and replaced and a .cddd cache file will be created but ignored. 
In the keep-files "nothing" mode, the .cddd flag is not created. Use this mode only if you are sure you are not going to download the same data twice at any point.
